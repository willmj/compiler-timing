"""Deterministic pass-level tests for dedup_and_promote_constants.

These tests do not depend on Dynamo/Inductor producing a particular
incidental graph shape. Instead they run the real
CustomPreSchedulingPasses pipeline up to (but not including)
dedup_and_promote_constants, snapshot the graph, optionally mutate
it into the exact deterministic condition each test needs, then
call dedup_and_promote_constants directly and assert on the
resulting state.

This hybrid approach was chosen (in preference to hand-built IR
dataclasses) so the tests still exercise real Torch-Spyre / Inductor
constructors, layouts, and provenance mechanisms — i.e. they still
represent pass invariants — while remaining deterministic:

* test_zero_consumer_duplicate — never skips.
* test_one_duplicate_many_consumers — proves consumers_by_name[D]
  fans out correctly when a SINGLE duplicate name D has multiple
  live ComputedBuffer readers.
* test_name_to_users_fold_exact — captures pre-dedup name_to_users
  entries for canonical and every duplicate by object identity,
  asserts post-dedup entries are exactly the concatenation and that
  duplicate keys have been removed.
* test_provenance_transform_appended — asserts merge_provenance
  appended a ProvenanceTransform with pass_name
  "dedup_and_promote_constants" to the canonical.
* test_no_duplicates_fast_path — with the E-only implementation
  we care that when no duplicate group exists we do NOT build the
  reverse index. This test snapshots V.graph state, calls dedup
  with zero duplicates, and asserts the pass exits without
  consuming get_read_writes beyond grouping. Against the pristine
  a9316b3 pass this test passes trivially (the pristine pass never
  called get_read_writes when there are no groups). After the
  E-only refactor, the same assertion must still hold.

Add this file to tests/inductor/ and add its path to
tests/configs/torch_spyre_tests/inductor/ (see
test_dedup_constants_config.yaml for the format).
